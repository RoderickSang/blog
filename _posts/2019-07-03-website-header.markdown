title: Adding My Site's Header Image
---

So I completed my site's navigation bar and admittedly that took much longer to make than I first thought. Writing your own code without a tutorial to follow really will humble you, I've found. But since I made it with flexbox, at least it looks nicely spaced and is responsive! 

There isn't much to see, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't proud of it.

I never really expected adding a header image to be a great learning experience, since it seems so simple. Follow any tutorial you want on creating a landing page or some sort of profile page and it'll look very intuitive. But writing the thing yourself is definitely a beast of its own.
