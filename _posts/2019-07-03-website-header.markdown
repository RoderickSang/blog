title: Adding My Site's Header Image
---

So I completed my site's navigation bar and admittedly that took much longer to make than I first thought. Writing your own code without a tutorial to follow really will humble you, I've found. But since I made it with flexbox, at least it looks nicely spaced and is responsive! 

There isn't much to see, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't proud of it. [Here's a link to a gif to show what that looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/nwI8AIT)

After getting this to work, I knew the next thing I wanted was some sort of header image. I've seen sites call it a "hero" image, but I'm not sure why. Is the size of the image heroic in some way? _Maybe one day I'll have my answer..._

Regardless, I spent a large amount of time trying to decide if I wanted this image to be a normal `<img>` HTML tag or a background image added in through CSS. They both seemed the same, aesthetically. 

I tried making it work with the background CSS property, but the image didn't want to appear at all. I assumed it was because the container I was trying to place the image into wasn't filled with content, so there was nothing for the background image to show up under. I struggled with this for a few more minutes before deciding just to test if the image would show up fine as an HTML `<img>` tag. It did!

I never really expected adding a header image to be a great learning experience, since it seems so simple. Follow any tutorial you want on creating a landing page or some sort of profile page and it'll look very intuitive. But writing the thing yourself is definitely a humbling experience.
